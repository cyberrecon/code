<p> Finally, apply the theme to your blog from your WordPress Admin Panel (Appearance option).</p>
<h2 class="style1">Theme Options</h2>
<p>ColorPress is a plug and play theme with the possibility of endless colors. All you have to do is activate the theme and set up the &quot;Theme Options&quot; from your admin panel. Here is a brief explanation of the ColorPress theme options :-</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Theme Color :-</strong> This setting lets you set the color setting for your ColorPress theme. Choose any color that you want and see the magic happen!</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation Menu :-</strong> Choose the pages, sub-pages, categories and sub-categories that you want to show in the navigation menu of your blog. If need be, you can turn off the category menu from the navigation.</li>
  <li><strong>Slideshow Options :-</strong> Toggle the slideshow on the home page. Choose the category for your slideshow posts and the no. of posts you want to show up there. You can even switch between the glossy and solid color appearance of the slideshow.</li>
  <li><strong>Mid Block Posts :-</strong> You can setup this special section of posts with its own category name, no. of posts. If you want, this can also be turned off. A Maximum of 3 posts can be pulled in this section.</li>
  <li><strong>Blog Posts Layout :-</strong> This is the best feature of this theme. You can now have your blog posts in a grid, excerpts or full posts. Just choose the setting and it applies automatically to your posts.</li>
  <li><strong>Sidebar :-</strong> With this setting, you can position your sidebar to the left or right of your blog as per your requirements. Also setup the twitter ID, facebook ID and  fill up your &quot;About&quot; section with a brief description about your blog.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertisements :-</strong> Toggle the 728x90 in the header and the 125x125 ads in the sidebar. Input your own code to replace the default placeholder images.</li>
  <li><strong>Contact Form :-</strong> Input your e-mail address here that you want the &quot;Contact Form&quot; page template to use to send emails.</li>
  </ul>
<p>After you have made any changes to any of the above settings, you will need to click on &quot;Save Changes&quot; button to apply it to your theme. To reset the theme back to its default settings, just click on the &quot;Reset&quot; button.</p>
<h2 class="style1">Setting up the Page Dropdown Menu</h2>
